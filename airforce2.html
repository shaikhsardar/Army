                                                bring No. 1 Squadron ostensibly to full strength, and this remained the sole IAF 
                                                formation when World War II began, although personnel strength had by now risen

                                                Problems concerning the defence of India were reassessed in 1939 by the 
                                                Chatfield Committee.&nbsp; It proposed the re-equipment of RAF&nbsp; (Royal Air 
                                                Force) squadrons based in lndia but did not make any suggestions for the 
                                                accelerating the then painfully slow growth of IAF except for a scheme to raise 
                                                five flights on a voluntary basis to assist in the defence of the principal 
                                                ports. An IAF Volunteer Reserve was thus authorised, although equipping of the 
                                                proposed Coastal Defence Flights (CDFs) was somewhat inhibited by aircraft 
                                                availability. Nevertheless, five such flights were established with No. 1 at 
                                                Madras, No. 2 at Bombay, No. 3 at Calcutta, No. 4 at Karachi and No. 5 at 
                                                Cochin. No. 6 was later formed at At the end of March 1941, Nos. 1 and 3 CDFs 
                                                gave up their Wapitis which were requisitioned to equip No. 2 Squadron raised at 
                                                Peshawar in the following month, and were instead issued&nbsp; with Armstrong 
                                                Whitworth Atalanta transports, used to patrol the Sunderbans delta area south of 
                                                Calcutta.&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 2 CDF had meanwhile received requisitioned D.H. 89 
                                                Dragon Rapides for convoy and coastal patrol, while No. 5 CDF took on strength a 
                                                single D.H. 86 which it used to patrol the west of Cape Camorin and the Malabar 
                                                Coast.</p>

                                                Meanwhile the creation of a training structure in India became imperative and 
                                                RAF flying instructors were assigned to flying clubs to instruct IAF Volunteer 
                                                Reserve cadets on Tiger Moths.364 pupils were to receive elementary flying 
                                                training at seven clubs in British India and two in various princely States by 
                                                the end of 1941. Some comparative modernity was infused in August 1941, when No. 
                                                1 Squadron began conversion to the Westland Lysander at Drigh Road, the Unit 
                                                being presented with a full establishment of 12 Lysanders at Peshawar by the 
                                                Bombay War Gifts Fund in the following November. No. 2 Squadron had converted 
                                                from the Wapiti to the Audax in September 1941 and, on 1 October No. 3 Squadron, 
                                                similarly Audax-equipped, was raised at Peshawar.</p>

                                                The IAF VR was now inducted into the regular IAF, the individual flights 
                                                initially retaining their coastal defence status, but with Japan&#39;s entry into 
                                                the war in December, No. 4 Flight, with four Wapitis and two Audaxes, was 
                                                despatched to Burma to operate from Moulmein. Unfortunately, four of the 
                                                flight&#39;s six aircraft were promptly lost to Japanese bombing and, late in 
                                                January 1942, No. 4 Flight gave place in Moulmein to No. 3 Flight which had 
                                                meanwhile re-equipped with four ex-RAF Blenheim ls. For a month, these Blenheims 
                                                were to provide almost the sole air cover for ships arriving at Rangoon harbour.</p>

                                                1974-75 and plans for the qualitative upgrading of the entire Air Force were 
                                                continually refined. The IAF handed over its Super Constellations to the Navy in 
                                                1975. The early seventies saw force levels being consolidated, and training in 
                                                new weapons-systems and evolution of new tactics being honed.

                                                By the mid &#39;70s, the IAF was clearly in need of urgent re-equipment decisions 
                                                and various requirements, better known by their acronyms DPSA, TASA, METAC and 
                                                HETAC, were pursued and decisions were forthcoming at last. The period, the IAF 
                                                was to benefit from a crest in the eighties, the period 1978-88 witnessing a 
                                                major modernisation programme which replaced most of the earlier generation and 
                                                obsolete equipment with spanking new aircraft types and weapon systems. No less 
                                                than twenty new aircraft types and sub-types entered the IAF&#39;s service over 
                                                these years, including various strike fighters, third-generation supersonic 
                                                interceptors, tri-sonic reconnaissance aircraft, strategic heavy lift

                                                First off the mark was selection of the Jaguar strike fighter, to meet the IAF&#39;s 
                                                urgent Deep Penetration Strike Aircraft (DPSA) requirement, to replace the 
                                                Canberra and Hunter still soldiering on in this exacting role. After many years 
                                                of evaluation and negotiation, the Anglo-French fighter was contracted for, an 
                                                interim batch of ex-RAF Jaguars being accepted to re-equip No. 14 Squadron. IAF 
                                                pilots and technicians received conversion training with the RAF and British 
                                                Aerospace in Lossiemouth, Coltishall and Warton before ferrying the first 
                                                Jaguars to India in July 1979. These were followed by a batch of U.K. built 
                                                Jaguars to re-equip No. 5 Squadron even as simultaneously, HAL prepared for 
                                                production of the aircraft, its powerplants, avionics and accessories in India. 
                                                By the mid-80s, the Jaguar was in service with Nos. 5, 14, 16 and 27 Squadrons 
                                                while a flight of No.6 Squadron was equipped with the Maritime Jaguar carrying 
                                                the new generation Sea Eagle anti-ship sea-skimming missile. The Jaguar strike 
                                                fighter was equipped also with Magic air-to-air missiles on unique overwing

                                                Meanwhile, in 1976, the &quot;third generation&quot; MiG-21bis, considered the definitive 
                                                variant of the classic tailed-delta fighter design, was to follow-on the &quot;M&quot; 
                                                sub-type, as a multi-role air superiority/ground attack version. The MiG-21bis 
                                                assumed the prime air defence mantle and sufficient numbers were acquired in 
                                                1976-77 to equip three squadrons (Nos. 15, 21 and 23) formerly operating the 
                                                Gnat light fighter. With some 580 MiG-21s delivered by HAL and nearly 250 
                                                MiG-21s (including the two-seat operational trainers) imported as &quot;fly aways&quot;, 
                                                the type remained an immense asset for the Indian Air Force for over a quarter 
                                                century. The quantity vs. quality dilemma inevitably faced by most of the 
                                                world&#39;s air forces as a consequence of spiralling costs was mitigated for the 
                                                IAF by the large scale availability of the MiG-21, which type will surely go 
                                                down as one of aviation history&#39;s all-time classics.

                                                The next requirement to be met was for a Tactical Air Strike Aircraft (TASA).

                                                of India concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union for the MiG-23 
                                                variable-sweep fighter. Four squadrons, then flying the HF-24 and Sukhoi Su-7 
                                                were re-equipped with the MiG-23BN and induction into IAF service of this 
                                                swing-wing fighter. Nos. 10 and 220 Squadrons were shortly operational on the 
                                                new type and Nos. 31 and 221 followed to add a considerable measure of potency 
                                                to the offensive air support formations of the IAF. The dedicated strike 
                                                derivative, selected for licence production by HAL, was the MiG-27M which shared 
                                                the overall configuration of the BN but was optimised for low-level, high-speed 
                                                performance. The last Sukhoi Su-7 Squadron (No.222) became the first MiG-27M 
                                                unit and the Ajeet light fighter squadrons were gradually re-equipped with the 
                                                MiG-27ML, No.9 being followed by Nos.18,22 and lately, No.2.</p>

                                                Induction of the new generation F-16 fighter by the PAF in 1981-82 was a 
                                                &quot;dejavu&quot; type situation for India and in order to counter such a challenge, the 
                                                Government contracted for the MiG-23MF air superiority version of the swing-wing 
                                                fighter, equipped with beyond-visual range missiles, and two new squadrons (Nos. 
                                                223 and 224) were formed on the type in 1982. However, these were considered 
                                                only an interim solution and, in the absence of suitable, known, Soviet 
                                                equivalents, India turned to Western sources for an advanced technology 
                                                interceptor. In&nbsp; 1982, a contract was finalised with France for the Mirage 
                                                2000 delta-wing, fly-by-wire fighter, with high agility and a formidable 
                                                radar/missile combination. IAF pilots and technicians had converted to the 
                                                Mirage 2000 at Mont de Marsan and ferried the fighters from France in the summer 
                                                of 1985. Two squadrons (Nos. 1 and 7) were re-equipped with the new French 
                                                fighter in 1985-86 and the Indian Air Force employed this multi-role advanced 
                                                technology fighter to good effect in a number of actions within the next few 
                                                years.

                                                Not too long afterwards, the Indian Air Force was, to be pleasantly surprised 
                                                when its test pilots were invited to evaluate the Soviet Union&#39;s latest,
