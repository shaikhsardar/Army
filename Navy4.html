                                                <strong><em>H</em></strong>ostilities broke out between India and Pakistan on 03 
                                                Dec 71. The twilight hours of 03 December turned out to be the dawning a new era 
                                                for the Indian Navy. On the very night that hostilities commenced, with Pakistan 
                                                bombing several air fields (03 Dec 1971), IN Ships Rajput and Akshay were 
                                                leaving Vishakapatnam harbour when they obtained a sonar contact. They fired 
                                                several depth charges, and proceeded on their mission when there was no further 
                                                evidence of a submarine&#39;s presence. Thereafter a loud explosion was heard 
                                                rattling windows panes off the Vishakapatnam beach. The Pakistani submarine 
                                                Ghazi (a Tench class submarine obtained from the USA in 1964) had come to grief.

                                                <strong><em>T</em></strong>he Indian Navy&#39;s aircraft carrier and her aircraft 
                                                played a decisive role in the Eastern theatre of the war. The Seahawk and Alize 
                                                squadrons wrecked havoc on vital installations in East Pakistan. Very shortly, 
                                                the Indian Navy&#39;s Eastern Fleet was in complete control of the sea and the 
                                                surrounding air space. Pakistani troops, desperate to escape, sought to use 
                                                merchant ships for military purposes. Four Pakistani tugs, the merchant ship 
                                                Baquir, and a Liberian ship were intercepted and escorted to Indian ports. Many 
                                                others were either scuttled or captured. Moonless nights were selected for the 
                                                missile boat attack on Karachi harbour. The attack was one of the historic

                                                only Indian ship lost during the 1971 operations was the frigate INS Khukri.</p>
