                                                            over the entire Konkan Coast, keeping the English, Dutch and Portuguese at bay. 
                                                            The death of Angre in 1729, left a vacuum in leadership, and this resulted in 
                                                            the decline of the Maratha sea power.</p>

                                                            Despite the eclipse of Indian kingdoms with the advent of western domination, 
                                                            Indian shipbuilders continued to hold their own well into the nineteenth

                                                            superior to their British counterparts both in design and durability. This so
