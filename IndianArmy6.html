                                                            when the gallantry awards were instituted.&nbsp; The superb choice of Vajra 
                                                            (thunderbolt) to serve as the motif for the Param Vir Chakra amply proves this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                                                            Great mythology surrounds this mysterious weapon of Vedic origin.&nbsp; It was

                                                            a heavenly body known for its firm, steady and fixed position, symbolically

                                                            Vishnu in appreciation of his firm determination and supreme effort.&nbsp; The 
                                                            polar star is therefore, called Dhruva Tara in Indian mythology.</p>

                                                            forward movement.&nbsp; In 4th century BC, the Buddhists adopted this symbol in 
                                                            the service of religion, calling it the Dharma Chakra.&nbsp; The preaching of

                                                            was called Dharma Chakra Parvartana.</p>

                                                            This motif when represented along with the motto &#39;Satyameva Jayate&#39; represents 
                                                            the National Emblem.&nbsp; Three lions facing the four directions are again 
                                                            Buddhist in significance.&nbsp; They symbolise the universal application of the 
                                                            Dharma comprehending all the four directions i.e. east, west, north and south.&nbsp; 
                                                            In respect of medals, the symbol represents service of a very high order.</p>

                                                            for self-effacement and dedicated service; green for growth and auspiciousness;
