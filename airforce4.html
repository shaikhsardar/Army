                                                military aid. Indian Government conveyed to the Maharaja that it would be 
                                                legitimate to send the Indian troops to Kashmir only after Kashmir is formally 
                                                acceded to India. By 26th Oct, Kashmir looked indefensible and Pak militiamen 
                                                were knocking at the doors of Srinagar and were just 50 km away. At this late 
                                                stage, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession. J &amp;

                                                aircraft of the Maharaja and were short and unpaved. There were no navigational

                                                8. In the Poonch Sector along the Pakistan-Kashmir border, the Indian troops had 
                                                taken up tactical positions in the important towns along the Jammu-Srinagar 
                                                Highway at Sunderbani, Naushera, Borripatam, Bhimber, Mirpur, Kothi, Rajouri and 
                                                Poonch. They were constantly being troubled by the invaders who had entrenched 
                                                themselves in the hills. The Indian Army had a great problem at their hands i.e. 
                                                provisioning of supplies not only for the troops but also for the forty thousand 
                                                refugees. With the road link to Jammu under threat of being cut off, the only 
                                                option was an air bridge to Poonch but there was no landing ground there. A 
                                                decision was taken to construct an emergency airstrip at Poonch. Six thousand 
                                                refugees worked day and night and constructed an airstrip within a record time 
                                                of one week. AVM Subroto Mukherjee and Air Cmde Mehar Singh landed the first ac 
                                                on the newly constructed airstrip at Poonch on 8th Dec 1947. The landing and 
                                                take off at Poonch was not easy as the Airstrip was surrounded by streams from 
                                                three sides and the approach was extremely steep. Despite these difficulties and 
                                                against heavy odds Air Cmde Mehar Singh created a sort of record by landing a 
                                                Dakota with three tons of load against normal rated load of one ton. In a span 
                                                of six days, No&nbsp;12&nbsp;Sqn RIAF carried out 73 sorties, averaging more than two 
                                                sorties per aircraft per day, carrying more than 210 tons of supplies to Poonch 
                                                and evacuating thousands of refugees during the return journey. The air bridge 
                                                to Poonch was maintained for one year till the declaration of ceasefire on

                                                During the first week of Nov 1947, the enemy was able to close in undetected as

                                                the enemy concentration. After that the enemy was strafed so thoroughly that it 
                                                broke the backbone of their resistance. This engagement was the turning point as 
                                                it removed the immediate threat to Srinagar airfield and brought a successful

                                                areas causing heavy damage to enemy strongholds. The strikes over vital enemy 
                                                strongholds at Pilandri, Domel and Kishan Ganga bridge had effectively stopped

                                                barren land East of Kashmir. There were small villages along the river Indus. 
                                                During the spring of 1948, the invaders captured Skardu Fort and cut off the 
                                                road link from Srinagar to Leh. The garrison at Leh was too weak in numbers and 
                                                armament stores to offer any meaningful resistance to the invaders and was 
                                                poised to be overrun. Maj&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;KS&nbsp;Thimayya, GOC 19 Div had realised that the only 
                                                way to save Leh was to augment supplies through the air. Landing a low ceiling 
                                                aircraft like `Dakota’ at such high altitude after negotiating Himalayan 
                                                mountain ranges, was the greatest challenge any pilot could have thought of.

                                                12. 24th May 1948 was a historic day in the history of Indian Air Force when Air 
                                                Cmde Mehar Singh, with Maj Gen Thimayya as passenger, led a flight of Six 
                                                Dakotas of 12 Sqn RIAF across the high mountain ranges of Himalayas, towering up 
                                                to 24,&nbsp;000 feet negotiating the Zojila and Fatula Passes and landed at an 
                                                improvised sandy airstrip next to the Indus river at a height of 11,&nbsp;540 feet. 
                                                Air Cmde Mehar Singh in his ancient Dakota didn’t have the luxury of de-icing 
                                                equipment, cabin pressurisation or route maps. A big airlift was called for to 
                                                save Leh but the weather wouldn’t co-operate and no airlift could take place for 
                                                the next three days. From 28th May 1948 onwards, braving all odds, No&nbsp;12&nbsp;Sqn

                                                12 Sqn flew 700 sorties and airlifted 1000 tons of stores during the air bridge

                                                13. The large scale operations in Jammu and Kashmir were planned, directed and 
                                                conducted almost entirely by Indian officers. The few British officers still 
                                                holding some senior appointments in India gave some advice and assistance only 
                                                in the first few months of the operations. The Indian officers of whom Cariappa 
                                                was the senior most, had till then little experience in the higher planning and 
                                                conduct of war. It is a remarkable evidence of their high calibre and 
                                                professional competence that they managed so well the long compaign which took

                                                14. As already related, there had been no previous planning at all for any 
                                                military action in J&amp;K. The first troops were flown to Srinagar with hardly a 
                                                couple of days’ planning and preparation. During the long campaign, the small 
                                                RIAF lost a total of 32 officers and men who laid down their lives for the 
                                                nation during these operations. In this roll of honour, there were no less than 
                                                9 officers. The enemy casualties were definitely many times the total of Indian 
                                                Army and RIAF casualties, and one estimate concluded that the enemy suffered 
                                                20,000 casualties, including 6,000 killed.</p>

                                                emphasised and it was the one weapon to which the enemy had no answer. Only the 
                                                impromptu air lift to Srinagar in October 1947, saved the Kashmir Valley. A 
                                                hundred planes landed every day on the improvised airfield at Srinagar, bringing 
                                                in troops, ammunition and supplies and evacuating casualties and the refugees. 
                                                The Air Force and civilian pilots of these Dakotas defied the mountains, the 
                                                weather, and fatigue to continue the airlift till the valley was saved. Leh and 
                                                the entire Ladakh region was saved by Air Cmde Mehar Singh and his gallant boys;

                                                untested air strip at Leh. Flight Lieutenant DE Pushong similarly landed the 
                                                first Dakota at Punch, and made almost a hundred landings thereafter, bringing 
                                                in, often under enemy shelling, the urgently needed 25 pounder gun and essential 
                                                supplies. Sqn Ldr VP Hegde, Flight Lieutenant LS Grewal and Flight Lieutenant DN 
                                                Ghadiok were among the many other transport pilots who supplied the hard-pressed

                                                Sqn Ldr RS Kalavaniwala accurately and repeatedly attacked enemy positions at

                                                was superb indeed. Not only Air Cmde Mehar Singh, the AOC of No. 1 Group RIAF

                                                the heights predominating the Siachin glacier, also referred to as the world&#39;s 
                                                third pole and potentially a dangerous flash point on the disputed Northern 
                                                borders. IAF Il-76s, An 12s and An 32s transported stores and troops, airdropped 
                                                supplies to high altitude airfields while Mi-17s, Mi-8s, Chetaks and Cheetahs

                                                1984, the IAF&#39;s incredible performance at the extremes of temperature and

                                                Operation Pawan, the mission of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 
                                                northern and eastern Sri Lanka, lasted some thirty months and the statistics 
                                                tell it all: some 70,000 sorties were flown by the IAF&#39;s transport and 
                                                helicopter force to and within Sri Lanka, without a single aircraft lost or 
                                                mission aborted. In support of nearly 100,000 troops and paramilitary forces, 
                                                IAF An32s maintained a continuous air link from air bases in Southern India to 
                                                Divisional headquarters at Palaly (Jaffna), Vavuniya, Trincomalee and 
                                                Batticaloa, transporting men, equipment, rations and evacuating casualties on 
                                                the outbound flights, No. 19 Squadron being the main formation involved. 
                                                Earlier, during the massive build up in the Jaffna peninsula in October 1987, 
                                                the IAF carried out more transport and helicopter sorties in support of the 
                                                ground forces in action than at any such concentrated space and time in 
                                                thehistoryofthearmed forces of India. In 20 days, some 3000 tactical transport 
                                                and assault helicopter sorties were carried out during the bitter fighting to 
                                                disarm the LTTE as a key proviso of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord.</p>

                                                helipads throughout the Northern and Eastern provinces, becoming the critical

                                                utilised to provide suppressive fire against militant strong points and to

                                                The third action was coded Operation Cactus. On the night of November 3, 1988, 
                                                the Indian Air Force mounted special operations to airlift a parachute battalion

                                                India to the remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives. In response to 
                                                that Government&#39;s appeal for military help against a mercenary invasion, the 
                                                IL-76s of No. 44 Squadron landed at Hulule at 0030 hours, the Indian

                                                hours. Buildup of forces continued the next day, with IL-76s, An-2s and An-32s 
                                                flown to the Maldives from Trivandrum, while IAF Mirage 2000s made low level 
                                                passes over the scattered islands in a show of force. The most immediate reality 
                                                that emerged from this brief, and bloodless, action was the swift and effective 
                                                Indian military response, made possible by the IAF&#39;s strategic airlift
