&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National cadet Corps (NCC) represents one of the positive forces in shaping, especially the 
                                                            values of the youth in our country. Those who join the NCC are subject to 
                                                            discipline NCC tries to inculcate better values in them. In fact the discipline 
                                                            which an NCC cadet undergoes may play a large role in shaping his values, 
                                                            deciding his career and also his attitude to life. Rabindranath Tagore said that 
                                                            every time a child is born, it shows that God has not lost faith in mankind. 
                                                            With a population of more than one billion, we also have a very large percentage 
                                                            of people below the age of 35, to the extent of at least 50%. NCC inculcates in 
                                                            the youth a sense of nationalism and secular outlook that contributes towards 
                                                            the building of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                            students. The NCC is emerging as a major source of recruitment of officers for 
                                                            the armed forces. In fact, 25 per cent of cadets currently training to be

                                                            NCC. And the figure is even higher for women cadets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                            NCC was conceived in 1917 when India Defence Act was promulgated with an object 
                                                            of making up the deficiencies in the Armed Forces by raising the University 
                                                            Corps. In 1920, with the passage of India Territorial Act, University Corps was 
                                                            replaced by University Training Corps. In 1942, this Corps was rechristened 
                                                            University Officers Training Corps. In 1946, a committee under Pandit H N Kunzru 
                                                            was set up at the behest of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to formulate the 
                                                            establishment of an organisation capable of training and motivating the youth of 
                                                            the country to become better citizens and leaders in all walks of life. 
                                                            Consequently, the National Cadet Corps came into being on July 16, 1948 with the 
                                                            promulgation of the NCC Act XXXI of 1948. NCC was placed under the Ministry of
