                                                history predates the birth of western civilisation. The world&#39;s first tidal dock 
                                                is believed to have been built at Lothal around 2300 BC during the Harappan 
                                                Civilisation, near the present day Mangrol harbour on the Gujarat coast. The Rig 
                                                Veda, written around 2000 BC, credits Varuna with knowledge of the ocean routes 
                                                commonly used by ships and </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">describes naval 
                                                expeditions which used hundred-oared ships to subdue other kingdoms.There is a 
                                                reference to Plava, the side wings of a vessel which give stability under storm 
                                                conditions: perhaps the precursor of modern stabilisers. Similarly, the Atharva 
                                                Veda mentions boats which were spacious, well constructed and comfortable. In 
                                                Indian mythology, Varuna was the exalted deity to whom lesser mortals turned for 
                                                forgiveness of their sins. It is only later that Indra became known as the King 
                                                of the Gods, and Varuna was relegated to become the God of Seas and Rivers. The 
                                                ocean, recognised as the repository of numerous treasures, was churned by the 
                                                Devas and Danavas, the sons ofKashyapa by queens Aditi and Diti, in order to 
                                                obtain Amrit, the nectar of immortality. Even today the invocation at the 
                                                launching ceremony of a warship is addressed to Aditi. </font>

                                                <font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the eclipse of Indian kingdoms with the 
                                                advent of western domination, Indian shipbuilders continued to hold their own 
                                                well into the nineteenth century. Ships displacing 800 to 1000 tons were built 
                                                of teak at Daman and were superior to their British counterparts both in design 
                                                and durability. This so agitated British shipbuilders on the River Thames that 
                                                they protested against the use of Indian-built ships to carry trade from 
                                                England. Consequently active measures were adopted to cripple the Indian 
                                                industry. Nevertheless, many Indian ships were inducted into the Royal Navy, 
                                                such as HMS Hindostan in 1795, the frigateCornwallis in 1800, HMS Camel in 1806 
                                                and HMS Ceylon in 1808. HMS Asia carried the flag of Admiral Codrington at the 
                                                Battle of Navarino in 1827 - the last major sea battle to be fought entirely 
                                                under sail. Two Indian-built ships witnessed history in the making: the Treaty 
                                                of Nanking, ceding Hong Kong to the British, was signed on board HMS Cornwallis 
                                                in 1842, whilst the national anthem of the United States of America, &quot;The Star 
                                                Spangled Banner,&quot; was composed by Francis Key on board HMS Minden when the 
                                                British ships were at war and attempting to reduce Fort McHenry in Baltimore, 
                                                Maryland. Numerous other ships were also constructed, the most famous being HMS 
                                                Trincomalee, which was launched on 19 October 1817, carrying 46 guns and 
                                                displacing 1065 tons. This ship was later renamed Foudroyant, and is reputed to 
                                                be the oldest ship afloat built in India. The Bombay Dock was completed in July 
                                                1735 and is in use even today. The period of 4000 years between Lothal and 
                                                Bombay Dock, therefore, offers tangible evidence of the seafaring skills the 
                                                nation possessed in the days of sail. Thus, in the early seventeenth century, 
                                                when British naval ships came to India, they discovered the existence of 
                                                considerable shipbuilding and repair skills, and a seafaring people-an ideal 
                                                combination for supporting a fighting force. </font>
